Basic C++ project


Application is compiled on Fedora distro with clang++ compiler

for package download type in command:
sudo dnf install clang++


After creating file with .cpp extension just compile it by using clang++ [name_of_file] in terminal


App is basically mine proposition for expanding fences. For initiation of mine idea i used percentages which could fit into formula a + a + b
Expansion to bigger areas on other hand gave me thought about abbreviated multiplication formulas.
